*CHANGES MADE*
    "Header" -- On the tab for Search Engine Optimization I fixed the button to make sure it directs to the part of the webpage it is talking about.
   
    "Order of Page" -- I cleaned up the HTML to fit the sequence of the webpage

    "Images" -- I added alt tags to the images to make sure they are easier to find and also have a reason for being there

    "SEO Optimization" -- I helped make the HTML more friendly to future changes and offered tags that will help google and other search engines share the website more.

    "Title" -- I made a concise and easy to read title for the webpage
